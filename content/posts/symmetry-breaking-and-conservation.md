From [nextbigfuture](http://www.nextbigfuture.com/): [Mach Effect Propulsion Levels Becoming Significant and Reliable](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2020/09/mach-effect-propulsion-levels-becoming-significant-and-reliable.html), so it appears momentum is not conserved under certain conditions. And [Casimir effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect) experiments demonstrate energy is not conserved. This means that the universe is asymmetric in some manner because conservation doesn't always work. [Spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_symmetry_breaking) describes how the universe could be in an asymmetric state yet still be symmetric overall.
