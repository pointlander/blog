From [nextbigfuture](http://www.nextbigfuture.com/): [Circuit Design Claimed to Harvest Tiny But Infinite Power From Brownian Motion](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2020/10/tiny-energy-harvested-from-brownian-motion-could-replace-low-power-batteries.html). This device is like [Maxwell's demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon), but Maxwell's demon has been [theoretically shown not to generate over unity energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%27s_demon#Criticism_and_development). I think the source of energy is from the [Casimir effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect). Thermal vibrations bend the graphene slightly, and then the Casimir effect bends the graphene some more. This results in the conductivity of the graphene decreasing which reduces the Casimir force. The graphene then flattens out, and the whole process is repeated. It should be possible to generate greater energy by placing the device in a warmer bath, but this will only work up to a certain point. Several years ago I designed a [device](https://github.com/pointlander/liber) with a similar principal of operation.
