I have been reading [Einstein's Unfinished Revolution, The Search for What Lies Beyond the Quantum](https://www.amazon.com/Einsteins-Unfinished-Revolution-Search-Quantum/dp/1594206198) by [Lee Smolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Smolin), and the chapter 'Physical Collapse of the Quantum State' caught my attention:

> One consequence is that energy is no longer precisely conserved. A metal block should slowly heat up as a result of all the collapses the wave functions of its atoms undergo.

A similar claim is made in the article [Objective-collapse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-collapse_theory#Problems_and_drawbacks_of_GRW). Cold fusion may not be fusion at all. It could be energy from the collapse of the deuterium atoms' wave functions in the palladium metal lattice.

Another interpretation of quantum mechanics is [Von Neumann–Wigner interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann–Wigner_interpretation) which requires consciousness to collapse the wave function. It has been shown that electrons in a block of metal may implement [Grover's algorithm](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20980849). This computation process occurring in a palladium metal lattice may play a role in the collapse of wave functions.

[Brillouin Energy](https://brillouinenergy.com) claims to have cold fusion working. They use electrical pulses to help drive the reaction. I think it might make sense to use a quantum random number generator to control the electrical pulses in some fashion. This would perhaps cause the reactor to cycle between being correlated and uncorrelated with the environment.
