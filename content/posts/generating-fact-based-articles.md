Recently there as been much buzz about a natural language machine learning model called [GPT-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-3). [OpenAI](https://openai.com) is going to create an API for this technology. I have signed for access to this API for the purpose of generating news articles. I want to feed facts into the model and see if it generates good news articles. The facts could be stored in a relational and searchable database. The user could query this database, get some facts, and then use the [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) to generate a news article.
