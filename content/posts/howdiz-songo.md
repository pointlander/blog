I assume something doesn't exist unless it is measured, and this includes time. Space-time is measured by the quantum vacuum driving time forward. Down on Earth, time moves more slowly than time up in orbit. This is because the presence of matter reduces the amount of quantum vacuum down on Earth, but what about moving objects? Time moves more slowly for moving objects. For this we need the physics of [Mike McCulloch](http://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.com/). His physics is based on [The Rindler horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rindler_coordinates#The_Rindler_horizon). When an object moves, a horizon forms limiting the wavelengths of the fields that can fit between the object and the horizon. This reduces the amount of quantum vacuum, and thus time moves more slowly for the object. In a black hole there is no quantum vacuum, so there is no time. Likewise in a hydrogen nucleus there isn't any quantum vacuum, so there is no time, and is this what really holds the nucleus together?
