I propose a quantum communication system using quantum computation. In this system there are two pools of qubits: a sender and a receiver. Some of the qubits of the sender are entangled with the qubits of the receiver. Three entanglement configurations are selected: A, B and C; A and B are configurations of the sender, and C is the configuration of the receiver. The overall system has two configurations which result in known qubit states with high probability. For sending a 0 the configuration AC can be selected, and for sending a 1 the configuration BC can be selected. So, AC and BC are both quantum programs which each have one solution with very high probability, and the overall system is just a quantum computer. Is the communication faster than light?
