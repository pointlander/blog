The [Matrix mechanics interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle#Matrix_mechanics_interpretation) of quantum mechanics defines a [commutator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutator): [A,B] = AB - BA with [x, p] = ih. My interpretation of the commutator relation is that particles are contradictions at the [Planck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_constant) scale.
