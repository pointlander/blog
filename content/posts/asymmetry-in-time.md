**Update:** See: [The EmDrive Just Won't Die](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a33917439/emdrive-wont-die/).

From [nextbigfuture](http://www.nextbigfuture.com/): [DARPA Laser Version of EMDrive Has a Test Result Better Than Commercial Ion Drive](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2020/09/darpa-laser-version-of-emdrive-has-a-test-result-better-than-commercial-ion-drive.html). These devices are composed of an asymmetric resonant chamber driven by a laser. I think the asymmetry in space causes momentum to not be conserved, but there is also asymmetry in time. I think turning the laser on and off randomly could improve the performance of the device by creating asymmetry in time.
