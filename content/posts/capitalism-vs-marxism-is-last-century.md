Capitalism vs Marxism was the economic conflict of the last century. The economic conflict of this century is programmers vs everybody else. Programmers create billion dollar business that destroy jobs, and other programmers try to destroy those businesses with open source software. A good examples of this is [RISC-V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC-V) destroying [ARM's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture) business. Most significantly, using crypto currency programmers tried to destroy all governments on earth.

Currently, working from home is taking off. The benefits of working from home are: reduced air pollution, less traffic, fewer traffic deaths, more family time, families need only one car, and living where you want which allows for lower housing costs. Working from home allows people to leave the cities and live in small towns. Working from home is enabled by broadband internet and software as a service collaboration tools. Programmers are going to kill large cities like New York City. Software and technology will define the society and economy of this century. Programmers will be at the center of this.
