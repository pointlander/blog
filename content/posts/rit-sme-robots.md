While going to school at [RIT](https://www.rit.edu/) I was a member of the [SME](https://www.sme.org/) robotics club. I developed software for the two robots we created. This first robot was built in 2000 for the purpose of moving parts around a factory floor. Video of this robot can be found [here](https://youtu.be/u-vWtDhdr6U). We continued building robots, and the next robot we built in 2003 was an outdoors robot in the form of a tank. Videos of that robot can be found here: [video 1](https://youtu.be/Lxxg8gKoz4M), [video 2](https://youtu.be/haEttfdn0wY), [video 3](https://youtu.be/FA0EmS0d0h4), [video 4](https://youtu.be/XVRpN9uMvmE), and [video 5](https://youtu.be/yxD30Oa2WcA). This robot was intended as an autonomous robot capable of navigating the outdoors. (We didn't quite achieve this.)
