Wikipedia edit wars are a well known tragedy of the commons problem. What is needed is an ownership model similar to Github, but then which version of an article is the correct version? Machine learning could be used to produce one correct article from all of the different article versions. The different article versions would be auto merged together. The [Transformer](https://research.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html) machine learning algorithm could solve the auto merge problem: [Generating Wikipedia by Summarizing Long Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10198). Instead of summarizing reference web pages to create an article, this algorithm could be used to summarize different versions of the same article. But why stop there? The same algorithm could be trained on code to auto merge git branches. This would save programmers lots of time.
