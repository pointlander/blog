One of the first pieces of software that I developed in 2000 was a script that captured images from a web cam and set them as my desktop. I also saved these images to disk. I have turned these images into a time lapse video of [RIT](https://www.rit.edu/) which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/pqB2uSUcpY4).
