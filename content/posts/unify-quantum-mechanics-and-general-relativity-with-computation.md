It is known that quantum mechanics is [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_Turing_machine). If the Einstein field equations are Turing complete, then a "relativity computer" could be built. (It is known that some differential equations are Turing complete.) Unification of quantum mechanics and general relativity is then a matter of converting quantum programs to relativity programs.
