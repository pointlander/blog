Einstein said ['God does not play dice'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-variable_theory#%22God_does_not_play_dice%22), but could it be that God is the only source of truly random information. This would mean that the randomness of quantum mechanics is from God's perspective non-random. God's primary means of intervening could be in the quantum world. In [Objective-collapse theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-collapse_theory) a source of randomness is used to drive wave collapse, so this means that God solves the [measurement problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurement_problem) in quantum mechanics. This would make God that which is correlated with everything. The best way of exploring these ideas is probably with a quantum computer.
