1. [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence), but machine learning can get us there. Machine learning is like the steam engine: good enough but not perfect. AGI is like a jet engine.
2. Complete simulation of any material. Everything would get better and cheaper really fast.
3. [Quantum Gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity) becoming a solved problem. This could lead to flying cars and real space ships.

So, there are several ways in which the singularity can happen, and in my opinion the above three things are happening at the same time.
