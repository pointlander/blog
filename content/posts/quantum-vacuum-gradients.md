**Update:** See: [Electrostatic accelerated electrons within symmetric capacitors during field emission condition events exert bidirectional propellant-less thrust](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04368) and [Horizon Engineers](https://physicsfromtheedge.blogspot.com/2021/02/horizon-engineers.html).

[MEMS Chips](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41378-019-0054-5) that measure the force of the [quantum vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_vacuum_state) have been produced. Should the measured force be the same in all frames of reference? From the standpoint of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) the answer is yes, but this means one frame of reference may measure a weaker quantum vacuum in another frame of reference that is moving faster. When that frame of reference accelerates a quantum vacuum gradient is created. This gradient may be responsible for the acceleration measured within that frame of reference. Does this [relativize the quantum](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Einstein_s_Unfinished_Revolution/FkdkDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22relativize+the+quantum%22+penrose&pg=PT129&printsec=frontcover) as [Penrose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penrose) wants? I don't know how to measure the quantum vacuum in another frame of reference from my frame of reference. If a quantum vacuum gradient were to be created would this cause acceleration?
