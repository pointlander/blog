In my previous post I put forward the idea that an atom could be computationally driven to decay. Such an idea would be classified as a [Low Energy Nuclear Reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_fusion). This means that nuclear decay is a form of computation with an output of 0 or 1, decay or don't decay. What is the nature of this computation? Quantum computation is known to be [unitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_matrix), so it appears the nature of atoms is to conserve information. I believe when information isn't conserved a nuclear reaction occurs. This nuclear reaction represents a non-unitary hyper-computation and a source of practically unlimited energy. The best way to test these ideas is with a [trapped ion quantum computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapped_ion_quantum_computer). The trapped ion(s) could be forced to perform a non-unitary computation.
