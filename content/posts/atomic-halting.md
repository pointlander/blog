The entropy of state changes of a halted program are low. To find the inputs to a program that cause halting a cost function of entropy of state changes could be used. (Apparently quantum computers can solve the [halting problem](https://www.quantamagazine.org/landmark-computer-science-proof-cascades-through-physics-and-math-20200304/) via [nextbigfuture](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2020/08/entangle-quantum-entangled-machines-can-verify-solutions-up-to-halting-problem-hardness-level.html).) I believe what holds an atom together is computation. It is a computation that has a high entropy of state changes. An atom could be induced to decay with the right inputs. Something like an atomic catalyst could allow any matter to be "burned", and this catalyst would be computational in nature.
