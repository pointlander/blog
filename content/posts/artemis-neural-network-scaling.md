[Artemis](https://www.artemis.com/) has a powerful wireless technology called [pCell](https://www.artemis.com/pcell). It appears that pCell might have a high computational cost resulting in scaling issues. They might be able to solve this problem by replacing portions of their algorithm with neural networks. If they have an accurate simulator, they could even replace the entirety of their algorithm with deep reinforcement learning. This could be a good application of analog computer based neural networks.
