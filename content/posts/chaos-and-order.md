The short run chaos of the verse drives the long run order of the verse. The verse tries to maximize the short run computational cost of the verse, and the overall computational cost of the verse is conserved, so the long term computational cost of the verse is minimized. The short run chaos acts as a random variable in the cost function of the verse defining long run order: [Chai](https://github.com/pointlander/chai)
