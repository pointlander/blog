The [Copenhagen interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copenhagen_interpretation) holds that there is only one reality and multiple possibilities, and the [Everett interpretation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Many-worlds_interpretation) holds that there are multiple realities with each corresponding to a possibility. It is possible to merge these two interpretations of quantum mechanics by allowing multiple realities to merge into one. Different realities are allowed to merge if the merge is unitary, that is time reversible. At the end of time all realities are merged together, and at the beginning of time there was one reality. As the universe decompresses it compresses all realities into one.
