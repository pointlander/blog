There is an interesting article on the computer scientist [Constantinos Daskalakis](https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-constantinos-daskalakis-wins-nevanlinna-prize-20180801/). The article talks about his work on [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium), machine learning, and neurology. The obvious idea here is that perhaps neuron behavior could be explained by game theory. Each neuron seeks an optimal strategy for playing some game. After all organisms operate through competition. This could mean that consciousness is a Nash equilibrium. In order to create [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) all we need to do is figure out what game neurons are playing.
