Mind pod is an iPod that attaches to both your brain and ears. The purpose is to generate music from your brain activity. There are two enabling technologies required for this idea to work. One enabling technology is a wearable brain sensor comparable to an MRI machine: [Openwater](https://www.openwater.cc/), and the second enabling technology is a neural network capable of generating music: [SampleRNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07837). Music generated from SampleRNN can be found [here](https://dadabots.bandcamp.com/album/coditany-of-timeness). To create music from brain activity all one has to do is record the brain activity from a user listening to some music and then use the recorded brain activity and the corresponding music to train a neural network. The trained neural network can then be fed brain activity and it will generate music. The human brain becomes part of this signal processing system which may result in better music being produced.

Why is this a good idea for Openwater? Openwater needs a mass market consumer product. Currently they are working on a medical imaging device. Fancy mathematics is used to reconstruct tissue structure that is illuminated with a holographic IR light source. A neural network is useful because the fancy mathematics isn't needed. The neural network should be able to learn how to turn raw sensor data into music. This is really an evolution of the [Muse](http://www.choosemuse.com/) product which is used for meditation. Openwater has the idea of using their technology to implement telepathy between users. I don't think people really want to know what other people are thinking, so music can be the filter. People can simply listen to the music generated by other peoples' mind.
