Based on the [Uncertainty principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) and the [Observer effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics)) when something is measured it is effected. From quantum mechanics, when a particle is measured a computation happens. When an atom in space is struck by a photon it is accelerated and a computation occurs. It may be the case that there is an equivalency between measurement, computation, and acceleration. Masses in space measure the volume of space, so space time accelerates and the universe expands. An infinite amount of measurment occurs in a black hole, so an infinite amount of acceleration of space happens within the black hole. There is infinite density of mass in a black hole, but also an infinite amount of space. The distribution of matter in space determines the acceleration of space time.
